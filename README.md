This is the original LAIS project from 2008/2009. It is a transparently
multithreaded 2D agent-based simulator based on RepastJ.

We have picked up the available code and models from that time and made
them public under the GPLv3 license in 2013. The code and models are
partially working as this is probably not the last stable release of the
time. Improvements are welcome.

If you use any of the code or models please use one of the following
